# Getting to know my application



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Recommendations

Considering that the design system was made to be a mobile interface, it's trully recommended to set the screen size to 375x812 by pressing F12 and setting to mobile view inside the developer options of your browser.

### Comments

First of all, I should start my comments by saying that I'm sorry, due to my routine, I've been really struggling to accomplish my obligations and have some free time, since i'm studying, working full time. But, I tryed to make my programming skill as clear as I could with the short time I had left.

### Technical Considerations

I chose to use some tools, such as styled components, material Ui (not entirely), handmade components, react router, axios, functional programming and various hooks. It was applyed some 'clean code' fundamentals, like unique responsability, searchble names and etc. To optimize the page performance, with a little more time, I would certainly use some memoization and code splitting. The architecture was idealized to attend some scalability standarts and have reusable components through the application. 

The css settings were made to make the responsiveness better. Furthermore. due to have a better UX, I chose to have a loading spinner until the page is mounted and the props and states are built. There is some additional css setting to make the web visualization possible. In addiction to that, I must say that I coulnd't find the img URL at the API, so I chose to make an asset folder and I used a downloaded book cover image.

About the version control, I had the intention to simulate a developing enviroment on the git flow through the merges, pushs and branches.


I trully hope that you guys enjoy the coding sample :D
